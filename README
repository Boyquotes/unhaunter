Private Repository/Project - DO NOT SHARE
============================================

Unhaunter is a sci-fi paranormal investigation game set in procedurally generated haunted locations with reality-distorting geometry.

**NOTE: This is a personal project coded in private â€” not to be shared outside the
explicitly allowed recipients.**

Key points that define this game: (what makes Unhaunter special)
* 2D isometric pixel art visuals.
* Casual open/close missions rather than campaign.
* Exploration and survival horror gameplay.
* Grounded in a sci-fi/realistic setting without superstition.
* Managing fragile sanity against disturbing forces.
* Pacing aimed for methodical decision-making.
* Epic mission conclusion by demolishing the entire location.
* Procedural generation, rooms connect in a node graph.
* Map layout rearranges over time confusing navigation.
* Gear is fixed per character class and cannot be bought.
* Upgrades come with challenges to ensure balance.
* Threats are always preceded by several scary warnings.
* Classes based around tactical interdependence.

(Most of these key points are not yet in the game - currently there's only a very basic demo)
