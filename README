Unhaunter
============================================

Unhaunter is a sci-fi paranormal investigation game set in procedurally generated haunted locations with reality-distorting geometry.

Key points that define this game: (what makes Unhaunter special)
* 2D isometric pixel art visuals.
* Casual open/close missions rather than campaign.
* Exploration and survival horror gameplay.
* Grounded in a sci-fi/realistic setting without superstition.
* Managing fragile sanity against disturbing forces.
* Pacing aimed for methodical decision-making.
* Epic mission conclusion by demolishing the entire location.
* Procedural generation, rooms connect in a node graph.
* Map layout rearranges over time confusing navigation.
* Gear is fixed per character class and cannot be bought.
* Upgrades come with challenges to ensure balance.
* Threats are always preceded by several scary warnings.
* Classes based around tactical interdependence.

(Most of these key points are not yet in the game - currently there's only a very basic demo)


NOTE: I recently opened the repository as Apache 2. I'm still heavily working on this
and there's a lot of changes to be made. Will update this README later on with more
up to date information.
